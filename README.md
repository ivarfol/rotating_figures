# Rotating figures
A simple python program for rotating figures on 3 axis  
when given the objects vertecies, edges and color  
you can change the rotating speed by changing the angle  
in the rotate functions, you the object will be rotating  
around the axis, so if you want it to rotate around its  
center, you'll have to create an object with (0, 0, 0)  
as its center
